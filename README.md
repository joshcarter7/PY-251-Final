# PY-251-Final

The text below is python code from my final project for an undergraduate class. The assignment I chose was to model the evolution of the early universe by starting with particles in 
random positions as a rough representation of the distribution of matter soon after the Big Bang. The particles were then allowed to evolve due to the force of gravity exerted by the 
other particles with varying time steps and total amounts of time elapsed. The end result showed “filament” structures that resemble what we expect structure of the early universe to 
look like.
